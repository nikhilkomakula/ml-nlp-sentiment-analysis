Machine Learning Project on Sentiment Analysis with Python

In Machine Learning, Sentiment analysis refers to the application of natural language processing, computational linguistics, and text analysis to identify and classify subjective opinions in source documents.

Sentiment analysis aims to determine a writerâ€™s attitude towards a topic or the overall contextual polarity of a document. The attitude can be his judgment or assessment, his emotional state or the intended emotional communication.
